# My Dotfiles (A collection of configs, assets and preferences on tools I use)

## VSCode

Settings.json is heavily based on a config I saw on r/vscode: [jsmlls/settings.json](https://gist.github.com/jsmlls/baa528ccbb7b03440fa23bd81d7edd43)

## Assets

### Wallpaper

Various wallpapers mainly from https://wallhaven.cc/

### Sounds

Audio files from various games that I sometimes use to replace Linux login and logout sounds.
